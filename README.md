# flip_trajectory_generation
This repository uses MATLAB solvers such as fmincon, ga and patternsearch to solve an optimization problem in order to generate feasible and optimal flip trajectories for quadrotors.
And, another implentation of the code is also being done in Python in order to use the different solvers of the Scipy package and compare the different results.
